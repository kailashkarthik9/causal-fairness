## Fairness with Multiple Protected Attributes A Causal Approach

### Kailash Karthik S and Shiv Vidhyut

### Causal Inference Spring 2020

Most of the contemporary literature on fairness and bias using causal inference have focused on counterfactuals which have made it disjoint to the rest of the classical machine learning literature. This project aims to draw parallels between the two ideologies by formalizing causal analogues of classical machine learning fairness notions including the impossibility theorem and existing metrics like Equalized Odds, Predictive Parity and Demographic Parity. The project also aims to extend current literature on causal fairness to multiple protected attributes by (1) investigating the effects of intervention on one protected attribute on the others and (2) developing a debiasing algorithm in multi-attribute scenarios. We also aim to find bounds on fairness in situations where the evaluation of counterfactuals is not feasible to make the causal metrics usable under a wider range of scenarios.
