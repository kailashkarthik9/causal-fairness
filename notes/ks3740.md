### Paper Summaries


* Fair prediction with disparate impact
    * Talks about Predictive parity and also mentions why the TP and FP rates can’t be the same across a protected attribute if the crime rates are different across different protected groups
    * Mentions how this notion of TP and FP occurs
    * Measures how misclassification impacts both the recidivators and non-recidivators across protected groups
* Counterfactual Fairness
    * Thus, counterfactual fairness can be thought of as a counterfactual analog of demographic parity, as present in the Red Car example further discussed in the next section.
    * Contains definitions of all the fairness metrics
    * Introduces the concept of counterfactual fairness and the three levels
    * Issue is the constraint on the observables having to be non-descendants of A which makes it not so usable
* Causal Interventions for Fairness
    * Tries to mitigate unfairness through interventional policies
    * Haven’t read the paper completely
* An Intersectional Definition of Fairness
    * Deals with multiple protected attributes and their interaction
    * Posits that the definition of fairness can not be defined with respect to the unfair current scenario in terms of unobserved confounders
    * Gives a metric differential fairness which is very similar to the log odds ratio in regression
* A Causal Bayesian Networks Viewpoint on Fairness
    * Conditioning on the sensitive attribute can actually be helpful in some cases if you can see the causal diagram and assume a linear model
* On Fairness and Calibration
    * Intuitively introduces the impossibility theorem
* Avoiding Discrimination through Causal Reasoning
    * resolving variables and proxy variables
    * Only theory no practical analysis
    * Scope for practical implementation and analysis
